#### Sharing & Commenting on Figma file with Stakeholders

#### Sharing the Figma file

Locate and click the "Share" button in the top-right corner of your file. 

#### Choose a sharing method:

- Via link: Click "Copy link". Adjust the permission settings (e.g., "can view" or "can edit") before copying. If you have a specific frame selected, the link will open to that frame. 
- Via direct invitation: Enter stakeholder email addresses directly into the "Send to" field. Adjust permissions for each person, then click "Send invite". 
- Move the file to a project (if needed): Files in "Drafts" cannot be shared with edit access. Move the file to a project to enable sharing with edit permissions. 
- Consider sharing a prototype: For a more interactive experience, share a prototype by opening it in "Present" mode and using the "Share prototype" button to get a link.


#### Commenting on the file

- Enter comment mode: Click the comment icon in the toolbar or press C. 
- Click on the canvas: Click directly on an element or area of the design where you want to leave a comment. 
- Add your feedback: Type your comment in the composer. You can mention specific team members by using the @ symbol to tag them and send a notification. 
- Use reactions: Use reactions to provide quick feedback on comment threads. 
- Resolve comments: Once a comment has been addressed, click the checkmark to resolve it and remove it from the active comments. 



#### What are Teams Porjects drafts in Figma

#### Key differences

- Drafts: A personal, private space for creating and iterating on files without involving the whole team. 
- Team Projects: A shared workspace within a team where files are organized and accessible to all team members, facilitating collaboration. 

#### How to use them

- Create in drafts: Start new files in your personal drafts space. 
- Experiment privately: Work on designs, concepts, or wireframes without sharing them until you're ready. 
- Move to a team project: When a file is complete or ready for feedback, drag and drop it into the appropriate team project to make it accessible to the team. 
- Share with specific people: You can still share an individual draft with specific people you invite, but moving it to a project is how you make it available to your whole team.
