### What is Figma for & does it do the coding?

#### 🧠 What Figma is for

Figma is mainly used for UI/UX design — that means designing the look, layout, and flow of websites, apps, or any digital interface.

Here’s what you can do with it:
- 🎨 Design user interfaces (UI) — buttons, menus, icons, colors, typography, etc.
- 🧭 Plan user experience (UX) — page layouts, navigation flow, and interactions.
- 🤝 Collaborate in real-time — multiple people can work on the same file together (like Google Docs for design).
- 🧩 Prototype — you can make clickable mockups that simulate how an app or site would actually work.
- 🗂️ Handoff to developers — developers can inspect your designs, see measurements, colors, and even copy the CSS snippets Figma generates.


#### 💻 What Figma doesn’t do

Figma does not write or execute code (like HTML, CSS, or JavaScript).
However:
- It can generate basic CSS code snippets for design elements (like color, font, or spacing).
- You still need to translate your design into actual code using tools like:
- VS Code / Sublime / WebStorm (for web development)
- Or frameworks like React, Next.js, Vue, etc.


#### 🚀 In simple terms

Think of Figma as:

The blueprint for your website or app, not the actual building.

Designers use it to visualize and plan how everything looks and feels.
Developers then take those designs and build them with real code.

### What the difference between UI and UX in Figma

#### 🎨 UI (User Interface) — What it looks like

UI design is all about the visual side how things look and how users interact with them on the screen.

In Figma, UI design includes:
- Choosing colors, fonts, and icons
- Designing buttons, forms, menus, cards, etc.
- Creating layouts (like grids or spacing)
-Building responsive designs (for mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Maintaining a consistent style using design systems and components

💡 Think of UI as the “makeup and outfit” of your app — it’s what users see and touch.


#### 🧠 UX (User Experience) — How it works and feels

UX design is about the flow, logic, and usability — how the user moves through your app or website and how easy or enjoyable it is to use.

In Figma, UX design includes:
- Planning user flows (e.g., how a user signs up or checks out)
- Creating wireframes (simple layouts to plan structure before adding colors)
- Making interactive prototypes (clickable mockups that simulate the app)
- Testing navigation and usability
- Ensuring the design feels intuitive and smooth

💡 Think of UX as the “brain and behavior” of your app — it’s what makes the experience work well.
