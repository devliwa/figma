### What is Figma for & does it do the coding?

#### 🧠 What Figma is for

Figma is mainly used for UI/UX design — that means designing the look, layout, and flow of websites, apps, or any digital interface.

Here’s what you can do with it:
	•	🎨 Design user interfaces (UI) — buttons, menus, icons, colors, typography, etc.
	•	🧭 Plan user experience (UX) — page layouts, navigation flow, and interactions.
	•	🤝 Collaborate in real-time — multiple people can work on the same file together (like Google Docs for design).
	•	🧩 Prototype — you can make clickable mockups that simulate how an app or site would actually work.
	•	🗂️ Handoff to developers — developers can inspect your designs, see measurements, colors, and even copy the CSS snippets Figma generates.

💻 What Figma doesn’t do

Figma does not write or execute code (like HTML, CSS, or JavaScript).
However:
	•	It can generate basic CSS code snippets for design elements (like color, font, or spacing).
	•	You still need to translate your design into actual code using tools like:
	•	VS Code / Sublime / WebStorm (for web development)
	•	Or frameworks like React, Next.js, Vue, etc.

🚀 In simple terms

Think of Figma as:

The blueprint for your website or app, not the actual building.

Designers use it to visualize and plan how everything looks and feels.
Developers then take those designs and build them with real code.
