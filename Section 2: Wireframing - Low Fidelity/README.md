## What is Lo Fi Wireframe vs High Fidelity in Figma

### 🧱 1️⃣ Low-Fidelity (Lo-Fi) Wireframes

#### What It Is

A Lo-Fi wireframe is a rough, simple sketch of your layout and structure — it focuses on function, not looks.

It’s like a blueprint for a house: you’re planning where things go, not what color the walls are yet.

🔹 In Figma, Lo-Fi means:
- Black, white, and gray (no colors or fancy styles)
- Basic shapes: boxes, circles, lines
- Placeholder text (“Lorem ipsum” or “Text”)
- Rough layout only — no images or icons
- Used to plan structure and flow

🔹 Purpose:
- Fast to create and easy to change
- Focuses discussions on usability and layout, not colors or fonts
- Great for early brainstorming and feedback

#### 🎨 2️⃣ High-Fidelity (Hi-Fi) Wireframes

🔹 What It Is

A Hi-Fi wireframe (or mockup) is the final visual version of your design.
It looks real, almost like a finished product — complete with branding, colors, fonts, and images.

🔹 In Figma, Hi-Fi means:
- Full color palette, real text, and images
- Real UI components (buttons, icons, input fields)
- Consistent spacing and alignment
- Interactive elements (hover effects, links, transitions)
- Ready for developer handoff

🔹 Purpose:
- To show exactly what the user will see
- Used for client presentation or developer implementation
- Helps finalize the design before coding

## Creating our design file & introducing frames in Figma

### 🗂️ Step 1: Creating a New Design File
1. Open Figma → go to figma.com.
2. On your dashboard, click “+ New design file” (or press Ctrl + N / Cmd + N).
3. A blank canvas appears — this is where you’ll design your app, website, or wireframes.

You can rename your file at the top (e.g., “My Portfolio UI” or “Login Page Design”).


### 🧱 Step 2: Introducing Frames (the building blocks)

🔹 What is a Frame?

A Frame in Figma is like a container or canvas within the canvas.
It can represent:
- A screen (like “iPhone 14 Pro” or “Desktop 1440px”)
- A section of your design (like a navigation bar or card)
- A group of elements you want to move or resize together

👉 You can think of frames like artboards in other design tools (e.g., Adobe XD, Sketch).

🔹 How to Create a Frame

There are 3 easy ways:
1. Press the Frame tool → shortcut: F
2. In the right panel, select a preset size (e.g., “Desktop”, “iPhone SE”, “Tablet”)
3. Or just click and drag on the canvas to draw a custom-sized frame.


🔹 Naming Frames

Always name your frames for clarity — like:
- Login Screen
- Homepage
- Product Card
- Header

✅ You can rename by double-clicking the frame name in the Layers panel on the left.

### 🧩 Step 3: Adding Elements Inside a Frame

Now that your frame is ready:
1. Use the Shape tools (R for rectangle, O for circle, T for text)
2. Add UI elements inside your frame
3. Use alignment and spacing tools in the top bar to keep things neat
4. Try resizing the frame — all items inside will move with it

### 💡 Pro Tip:
If you select an element and press Shift + A, Figma wraps it in an Auto Layout frame, which helps align and space items automatically (great for buttons, cards, lists, etc.)


### 🎯 Step 4: Organize Your Frames

As your design grows:
- Use multiple frames to represent multiple screens (e.g., “Home”, “About”, “Contact”)
- You can then prototype transitions between frames later (to simulate a real app)
