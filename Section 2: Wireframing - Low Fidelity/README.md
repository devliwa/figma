## What is Lo Fi Wireframe vs High Fidelity in Figma

### 🧱 1️⃣ Low-Fidelity (Lo-Fi) Wireframes

#### What It Is

A Lo-Fi wireframe is a rough, simple sketch of your layout and structure — it focuses on function, not looks.

It’s like a blueprint for a house: you’re planning where things go, not what color the walls are yet.

🔹 In Figma, Lo-Fi means:
- Black, white, and gray (no colors or fancy styles)
- Basic shapes: boxes, circles, lines
- Placeholder text (“Lorem ipsum” or “Text”)
- Rough layout only — no images or icons
- Used to plan structure and flow

🔹 Purpose:
- Fast to create and easy to change
- Focuses discussions on usability and layout, not colors or fonts
- Great for early brainstorming and feedback

#### 🎨 2️⃣ High-Fidelity (Hi-Fi) Wireframes

🔹 What It Is

A Hi-Fi wireframe (or mockup) is the final visual version of your design.
It looks real, almost like a finished product — complete with branding, colors, fonts, and images.

🔹 In Figma, Hi-Fi means:
- Full color palette, real text, and images
- Real UI components (buttons, icons, input fields)
- Consistent spacing and alignment
- Interactive elements (hover effects, links, transitions)
- Ready for developer handoff

🔹 Purpose:
- To show exactly what the user will see
- Used for client presentation or developer implementation
- Helps finalize the design before coding
